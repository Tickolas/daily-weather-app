## Weather App

This is a simple app to show my code style and problem solving skills
by calling a weather API and fetching data, which is then shown in a
chart.

### Installation

Run the following command in the app root and under dev-server:

`yarn install`

### Running the app

To run, first go into the dev_server folder and run `node cors-server`. 
This will start a simple server that ignores CORS issues.
Then go to the root folder and run `yarn start`.

You can now reach the application by going to http://localhost:3000.

### Testing

Tests can be run with `yarn test`.
